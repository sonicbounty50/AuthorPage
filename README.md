# AuthorPage
AuthorPage is a community template designed for the self-published, independent Authors in mind. AuthorPage provides News, Discussion, Books, and About Author tabs for further advertisement and community building for whoever wants to tweak it! Computer Illiterate? No problem! Follow our visual guide for step by step instructions on how to configure AuthorPage for you. 

AuthorPage works terrifically with a Drupal Web Server, which you can utilize on your own server by downloading their free software at Drupal.org.

AuthorPage uses Web Views along with interactive menus to drive its front end on all modern day iOS devices. Because the application itself isn't very complex, customizing it for the uses of the computer illiterate shouldn't be too hard of a stride.
